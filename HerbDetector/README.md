# Herb Detector by JJOverload

This detector aims to help create a dataset for training an image classification model, which can potentially recognize different types of herbs.

**Step 1: Gathering Unfiltered Google Images for Dataset**

Check out this repo for more information of how to using "simple_image_download":<br>

(However, I did find that the quick start code needed some updating/fixing in order to run. 'get-herb-images.py' has worked with this so far.)

From scratch, get images by running:<br>
`python3 get-herb-images.py`

(Be sure to remove existing images from directory before running again... Unless you want duplicates!)
